  title: Energy Footprint Notification
  description: |
    ## Overview
    The Energy Footprint Notification (EFN) API provides the API Consumer 
    with information about the E2E energy consumption and carbon footprint of a
    Service exposed by a set of applications instances.
    ## Introduction
    The scenario foresees a Service provided by many applications instantiated
    and running in different locations in the Telco Cloud owned by a Telco
    Operator.The EFN API provides the API Consumer (e.g. the Service Provider)
    with the information about the overall E2E energy consumption and carbon
    footprint (greenhouse gasses emissions) of the Service produced by all
    applications instances hosted by the Telco Operator.
    The reported energy consumption and carbon footprint consider the energy
    used to run the applications instances in the Data Centers and the energy
    absorbed along the Operator's network to provide the Service for the Telco
    Operator's subscribers.
    (e.g., RAN and Core Network energy consumption).\
    \
    **Example use case and flow:**\
    \
    [**Edge Service**](https://github.com/camaraproject/\
    EnergyFootprintNotification/blob/main/documentation/API_documentation/\
    EFN_UserStory_UseCase_1.md)\
    \
    **The parameters of the EFN API are:**\
    \
    **TargetRequest:**
    Provides to the API Producer the information about the target Service (as a
    set of application instances) and the period of time of interest.\
    \
    **EnergyResponse:**
    Provides to the API Consumer the requested information about the energy
    consumption for the target Service, considering all the active instances,
    in the period of time of interest.\
    \
    **CarbonFootprintResponse:**
    Provides to the API Consumer the information about the carbon footprint for
    the target Service, considering all the active instances, in the period of
    time of interest.
    # Authorization and authentication
    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on how
    an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and
    Consent Management
    (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the profile.\
    \
    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during
    the onboarding process, happening between the provider of the application
    consuming the API and the operator's API exposure platform, taking into
    account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being
    subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.\
    \
    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can
    exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out,
    the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that
    the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the
    principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.
    ## API Documentation
    ## Details
    The Energy Footprint Notification (EFN) API provides, to the API Consumer,
    information about the E2E energy consumption and carbon footprint for a
    specified Service that is provided by a certain number of active instances
    of some applications. The API provides information about the E2E aggregated
    energy consumption and carbon footprint considering all the active instances
    and network involvement, in a specific time period in which the Service is
    provided to end users. The application instances that are monitored
    for their energy consumption are the one managed by the Operator and that
    run on top of the Operatorâ€™s infrastructure. The Service is deployed and
    managed via the Operator Platform (e.g via the [CAMARA Edge Cloud APIs](htt\
    ps://github.com/camaraproject/EdgeCloud). Consequently, the Operator
    Platform is aware of all the active instances supporting the Service and it
    is also aware of the energy consumption in the Data Centers hosting the
    applications instances providing the Service. The Operator's Network is
    deeply involved in the service provisioning, so its energy consumption is
    relevant to have and E2E view. The EFN API also considers the energy
    consumption and the carbon footprint for the netwrok traffic generated by
    the Operator's subscribers consuming the Service. The Service Provider
    activates a service using the Operator Platform to instantiate and activate
    the application supporting the Service in different Edge Data Centers.
    The Service Provider onboards the applications, deploys and activates some
    instances to enable the Service. Service customers use their devices to
    access the Service. The use of the service produces an energy
    consumption alongside the Operator's Network and on the Data Centers hosting
    the applications instances. The EFN API is used by a Service Provider to be
    aware of the E2E energy consumption of the Services. The Service Provider,
    via an EFN API Consumer, invokes the EFN API with the identifiers of the
    application instances supporting the target Service. A period of
    time can be specified. The EFN API provides back the energy consumption by
    the Service in that period of time.  The EFN API also provides back the
    carbon footprint related to the running of the Service.
    The EFN API is an intent based API.
    \
    The EFN API supports the following Intents:
    - Intent1: Which is the overall energy consumption for my Service in this
    period of time?
    - Intent2: Which is the overall carbon footprint for my Service in this
    period of time?

    The input for the above intents is:
    - Input_Intent1: Set of applications identifiers and period of time.
    - Input_Intent2: Set of applications identifiers and period of time.

    The output for the above intents is:
    - Output_Intent1: energy consumption in Kw/h.
    - Output_Intent2: greenhouse gasses emission in tonnes.

    The related endpoints are:
    - Intent1: /overall-energy-consumption
    - Intent2: /overall-carbon-footprint
